# Collection Registry

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ucldc/avram.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ucldc/avram)

Playing around with a django app for managing a registry of UC Libraries
Digital Collections.

## notes

```
virtualenv -p python3 --no-site-packages .
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install exhibit application - the exhibit app code can be placed anywhere, as long as a link is established from `exhibitapp/exhibits/` to `avram/exhibits/`, here I've put the avram and exhibitapp folders next to each other. 

```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/ucldc/exhibitapp.git
cd exhibitapp
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ../avram
ln -s ../exhibitapp/exhibits/
cp env.local.in env.local
```

Modify env.local with solr connection details then:
```
source env.local
```

Using msyql? add:

```
pip install MySQL-python==1.2.4
```

## load

```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata library_collection/fixtures/campus.json
python manage.py loaddata library_collection/fixtures/collection.json
python manage.py loaddata exhibits/fixtures/exhibits-2019-07-01-browseterm-retirement.json
python manage.py collectstatic

```

```
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=collection_registry.test_settings
# python library_collection/util/sync_oac_repositories.py
```

## Test:
The remoteuser shibboleth login won't work when testing. Use the collection_registry.test_settings module for testing, it adds the typical Django authentication module to the AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS list.

```
python manage.py test --settings=collection_registry.test_settings  library_collection
```

This also works for local development.

```
python manage.py runserver --settings=collection_registry.test_settings
```
